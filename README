Overview: 
This package includes tools for versatile generation of a password.

Dependencies:
0) standard c/c++ libraries and GNU-getopt (getopt.h)
1) Doxygen for making API documentation

Install:
0) edit Makefile
   (see comments there: clang++ or gcc and 32 or 64 bit archetecture)
1) > make
2) > make doc
   (requires Doxygen)
3) vpwd-gen/bin/vpwd-gen --help
   (to view options of main executable)

WARNING: 
This software uses a deterministic random number generator (Mersenne Twister)!
Which means that is is NOT suitable for key-generation. The passwords generated
can be reproduced given the seed and, thus, the seed value is as valuable as 
the password itself. However, this alows for "pretty good" passwords 
and portability (few dependencies). If the generator can be comprimised based 
on the generated password, a warning is issued.
Attempts are made to destroy sensitive data when this program exits.
